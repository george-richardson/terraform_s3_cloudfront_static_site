# terraform_s3_cloudfront_static_site

A module for creating static websites hosted in S3 and distributed through cloudfront, perfect for use with site generation tools such as [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The site will be given an SSL certificate generated with ACM and a DNS record in Route53.

# Usage

```
module "static_site" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/george-richardson/terraform_s3_cloudfront_static_site.git?ref=master"

  providers {
    aws.useast1 = aws.useast1
  }

  name           = "test.example.com"
  hosted_zone_id = var.hosted_zone_id
}
```

You need to include the providers block as ACM certificates for cloudfront distributions must be in the US-East-1 region and so needs a different provider that is able to access this region independent of the region chosen for the other resources. More info on using multiple providers for modules can be found in the [terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/usage.html#providers-within-modules).
